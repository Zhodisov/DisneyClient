4. **Creating a Heroku Account**

   - Sign up for a Heroku account [here](https://signup.heroku.com/).

   - Open a new tab for `DisneyParse` and `DisneyClient` on Heroku.
   - Click Deploy on both tabs and connect your Github repository.
   - Enable automatic deploy, and deploy your app.
   - Check the logs for debugging information and startup.
   - In the Overview section, configure dynos and activate web for both Heroku apps.
